🕹️ Boredom Buster Projects | Fun Projects

Welcome to my Fun and Entertainment Projects repository! 👋

This repo is my sandbox—a place where, whenever I'm bored or need a new coding challenge, I execute a small project using a different and interesting approach.

🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this repo is learning through fun. Every project here, instead of just aiming to work, attempts to:

    Build a simple tool using an unexpected technology.

    Test a concept (like data analysis) using unusual or quirky data.

If you're looking for examples of coding for fun and breaking out of the routine, you've come to the right place!
